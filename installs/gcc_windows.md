> Note: For the purposes of our tutorials you aren't required to install a compiler since for the most part we will be using STM32CubeIDE which comes with everything you need, and the tasks for tutorial 1 should be doable with an online IDE. However, we have seen cases where Windows users need to install a compiler on their own to make CubeIDE work properly, so this is here for reference. More info/instructions for Mac/Linux should be easily found on Google if you're into that.

Windows OS does not have any C/C++ compiler installed by default. This chapter teaches you how to install the MinGW C/C++ compiler. The whole process should take around **10-20 minutes**.

## Step 1

Go to this website [https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/) download the compiler

## Step 2

2.1) Open the downloaded setup tool, press the Install and Continue button, and you will reach this interface.

To test whether the installation is successful, type `g++ --version` in the terminal to check.
