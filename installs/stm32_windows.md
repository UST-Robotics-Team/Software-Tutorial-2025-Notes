## Download & Install

First download the STM32CubeIDE installer from our [Github](https://github.com/UST-Robotics-Team/Software-Tutorial-2022/releases/tag/Installer).

> :warning: **Warning**: NEVER place the PCB on top of your computer, it may kill your computer.

After you have installed the IDE, please follow the steps below to properly setup your **Integrated Development Environment.**

### Import the project files

Download the [2024-sw-tutorial.zip](../../images/2024-sw-tutorial.zip) we prepared for you below.

_Note that we may have some library changes from time to time. So always follow what the tutorial notes say._
