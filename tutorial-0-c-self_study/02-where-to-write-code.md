## Where do I write my code?

### Github Codespace (Very Recommended for Starting)

As we will start to learn how to work with multiple `.c` files in Tutorial 1 and your homework, please create a workspace on [**Github Codespace**](https://github.com/features/codespaces). The environment is similar to VSCode. However, we do not really recommend setting it up on your machine as it may be troublesome to install the C compiler (unless you already have it installed). Hence, we will use this for now.

However, if you insist to work on your computer's VSCode, please refer to our guide (the tutorial for Windows only):

* [**Windows**](main/installs/gcc_windows.md)

### CubeIDE

For robotics programming, we will teach you to install [**CubeIDE**](https://www.st.com/content/st\_com/en/products/development-tools/software-development-tools/stm32-software-development-tools/stm32-ides/stm32cubeide.html?dl=mDz41Ame3rsvInWnnBOgtQ%3D%3D%2CcZwAba%2BIy%2FG8DrU77U5EEghQuKOCpNSACfvi2bwE08ZENmt9WBEXUiTFvdmySC1TNkz3H0dEAD1mlAg7m066zK%2F%2FEiRsAU9fsh2Z8qjWUeqproTDa74wIxaZNYl1hc8eF0gQr7rlIcOFvgurma6ZSOcIVxYHcXIdvJ5AxC%2BjWa6UGFNZRkS7jDzol8Tpl0jvo%2FAMwRruaLwkCR%2FMlSU58%2BCO7kAgbbpI9k1Vk9wfiVIDHh0oLoPz8srvZAj96TsE29RwNdrqa5DDOqFkNATwOtfq6CcuEy9pRVfVZ3qne5KLKsG0slrZQbhGh4%2FQj8jZ6HR7SsRXbr3AoEgc4EqypbnffnzAqnjfo6JE9Ir0kfR1TifcvX1rsJBK9ih6p%2Fbw%2BnqV22OC7utWyvidL7rQyLfyuw2MzWI7bH8qtlwMkyfOYFJ2k%2Bdkhpuhbe5jf6GM\&uid=Pg30eCicqbj1AXYhNpUwb3QskPXfCpAM#get-software)**,** which is where you will spend the majority of your time during our tutorials. 

You are recommended to set it up **now**, but we will make sure your installation works in the first tutorial. Please refer to our guide:

* [**Windows**](main/installs/stm32_windows.md)
* [**MacOS**](main/installs/stm32_macos.md) 

If your computer cannot flash code to the board, please refer to the guide [**here**](main/installs/stm32_problems.md).

(We hope that it does not take too long for you to setup)
